# OS Security and Hardening – Learning Report 

## 🎯 Purpose of This Task
This repository documents my learning and understanding of **Operating System (OS) Security fundamentals**.  
The main goal of this task was not just to perform commands, but to **understand how an operating system protects itself** using users, permissions, firewalls, and services.

This task helped me build a strong foundation in **OS hardening concepts** as a beginner in cybersecurity.
